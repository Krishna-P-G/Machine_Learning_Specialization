# Machine Learning Specialization Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing the projects I have completed as part of my Machine Learning Specialization. This repository encompasses two comprehensive courses:

## Advanced Learning Algorithms

This course delves into the intricacies of cutting-edge learning algorithms, providing a deep understanding of their principles and applications. Through hands-on projects, I have honed my skills in implementing and optimizing various algorithms to tackle real-world problems.

## Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning

In this course, I explored the realms of unsupervised learning, recommender systems, and reinforcement learning. These advanced techniques are pivotal in extracting meaningful insights from unstructured data, making personalized recommendations, and enabling intelligent decision-making in dynamic environments.
